# Making Careed.

### Make your own opinions

 it shouldn't matter what people say about a framework until you put a good 200 hours into it.

 Frameworks are tools that literally make us more valuable.

 Its really important that you learn about the tools.


### Learn Javascript The Fun Way.

Is there a better way to learn about coding than actually *writing code* ???

Yes potentially reading code, but i think you don't **really** understand it until you have some repetition, and have seen the majority of errors it can spit at you.

#### Pick a part of your life, and improve it.

I find inspiration from growth and learning(being smarter than other people).

I find projects to get excited about and start to challenge myself.

Right now i'm on the hunt for a solid job. So i decided to build a trello clone to track my jobs.

# I would build it in *react* && *ember*

I would put them both on a rails api. I would get stuck on things.
